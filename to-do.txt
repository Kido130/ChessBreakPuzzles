Changes for Opening Display:

1. When showing next move:
   - Find all lines in the specific opening matching current position
   - Sort by number of plays
   - Show top 2 lines with their evaluations
   - Format: Move (eval)

2. If only 1 line matches:
   - Keep current behavior (show a correct and an incorrect move)
   - Use existing move display logic
   - Keep current styling

3. If 2+ lines match:
   - Both choices are correct
   - Show evaluations next to moves
   - Use neutral styling for both options
   - Let user pick which line to continue
   - Keep teaching the chosen line (Using #1 logic)

4. Remove:
        Whatever you need to match if you need to.

Key Changes:
- Show top 2 lines by plays
- Both choices valid if multiple lines exist
- Fallback to current logic if only 1 line
